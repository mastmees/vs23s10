# vs23s10 graphics library

This is work in progress, trying to get VLSI Solution's VS23S010D to work on
SPI only with acceptable speed and image quality. Depending on how acceptable
is defined, speed may already be there but image quality definately not, and
no guarantee that it will ever be.

Comes with font editor that allow creating fonts containing up to 256
characters per file, maximum 32 pixels high, 32 pixels wide. Suppors both
fixed and variable width characters.
